The primary aim of this application is to assist learners in practicing and improving their English language skills. 

The platform will feature two distinct operational modes: a structured environment for International English Language Testing System (IELTS) speaking practice and a more flexible "Free Chat" mode for general conversational practice. 

two principal deliverables: a fully operational web application and a publishable academic research paper detailing the project's design, methodology, and empirical findings.

The core vision is to create an effective AI-powered tool that caters to the linguistic needs of English language learners.

sequential development planâ€”progressing from high-level system design to the selection of core AI technologies (Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, and Large Language Models), and subsequently to specific feature development

primary evidence for scholarly claims -

data generated from user interactions, 
the performance metrics of the AI components 
the pedagogical effectiveness of the learning modules

The app need to - 
articulate novel contributions, 
employ a robust methodology, 
conduct thorough evaluations

 Not must for presentation -
 Planning for secure data handling, 
 ensuring user privacy, 
 obtaining informed consent, and 
 adhering to institutional review board (IRB) protocols
 
 Consideration -

low latency
Scalability - not for now
Statement - thing to worry about, can work around in presentation

Frontend - gradio
Backend - FastAPI (orchestrate the AI services and manage application logic)

most advantageous approach for this project - Mounting Gradio within FastAPI (Option 2), especially by leveraging a library like fastrtc 14, appears to be the most advantageous approach for this project.
